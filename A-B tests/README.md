# A/B test
Project Task
- Choose hypohesis to increase income  
Description:
- prioritizing hypotheses and separating our clients in two groups.Then we have to understand the difference between conversion and average bill of these two groups.Next step  was to define the result of a/b testing and realise whether we should stop or continue test after reaching statistical significance.
- Turned out that the best hypothesis is to add subscribtions in our website. It was proven with  average bill cumulative sum  and conversion rate. 
- At the end of the project adding subscriptions was explained that the amount of people who subscribed and got into B group is bigger than in a group so that conversion rate is higher and at the same time relative increase in average check of B group is bigger in further distance
