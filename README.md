# Yandex.Praktikum Data analysis projects
---
In this repository i  keep projects completed in [Yandex.Praktikum](https://praktikum.yandex.ru/profile/data-analyst/) and periodically add/upgrade them in here.

All projects are presented in the form of iPython Notebooks and readme markdown files.

| [Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)](https://github.com/Singlepimple/prj/tree/python-skills/Exploratory%20Data%20Analysis%20(EDA))| In order to define key features on which flat price is based I have researched and built a lot of graphs/barplots/plots. While i was doing it i found a pattern which is determined in everyday flat price definition.In the near Future i want to predict the same using machine learning models especially linear regression model |pandas,numpy,matplotlib,seaborn|
| [A/B testing](https://github.com/Singlepimple/prj/tree/python-skills/A-B%20tests)  | First task was to prioritize hypotheses and separate our clients in two groups.Then we have to understand the difference between conversion and average bill of our two groups.Next thing was to define the result of a/b testing and realise whether we should stop or continue test after reaching statistical significance.  |pandas,numpy,scipy, matplotlib.pyplot,seaborn|
| [Statistical analysis](https://github.com/Singlepimple/prj/blob/python-skills/Statistical%20research/Statistic%20research.ipynb) | In this project, I have analised two different tariffs in a  telecom to offer a better strategy to push the better one and fix another. To handle it i used my knowledge about statistics and checked distribution of tariffs and types of distribution so that i could chosse appropriate tools to prove my statistical research.After that i setup hypotheses:Null Hypothesis is average bill is equal of these tow tariffs and Alternative(H1)-that they are different.Then compared average bills between these two tariffs with statistical significance=0.5 and p-value proved that my null hypothesis can't be rejected   |pandas,scipy,numpy,matplotlib |

| [Cohort analysis](https://github.com/Singlepimple/prj/tree/python-skills/Cohort%20Analysis)  | Digital agency asked to check weak traffic sources to reduce costs on them so that we could reallocate the budget.We agreed to check all metrics and divide users by cohorts.Then I estimated KPI's such as Lifetime value(LTV), custumer aquisition cost (CAC), Retention rate, Return on money investments (ROMI) |pandas,numpy,scipy,matplotlib,seaborn |
