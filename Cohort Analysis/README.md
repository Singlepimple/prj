# Cohort analysis
Task
- As analyst i had to find less profitable sources of the Intternet traffic 
Description:

Digital agency asked to check weak traffic sources to reduce costs on them so that we could reallocate the budget.We agreed to check all metrics and divide users by cohorts.Then I estimated KPI's such as Lifetime value(LTV), custumer aquisition cost (CAC), Retention rate, Return on money investments (ROMI).
All these operations were divided in several steps such as :
- Data preprocessing
- DAU/WAU/MAU calculations
- Retention Rate calculation in cohorts
- Cohort analysis to calculate LTV
- САС 
- ROMI in cohorts and grouped by traffic source
- Analysis of profitable and non-profitable sources
